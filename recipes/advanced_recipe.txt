Difficulty: Advanced

Servings: 1

Kitchen Utensils: 
- Oven
- Baking dish
- Small saucepot 
- Fruit scoop
- Peeler
- Blender
- Kitchen scale
- Cooking brush
- Knife

Ingredients:
- 5.5 OZ of carrot
- 1 OZ of apple
- 2.5 OZ of ripe banana

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. Peel the carrot and then carefully carve it in the shape of a large hot dog bun, making sure to scoop out the inside delicately.

3. Using your kitchen scale, weigh your carved carrot to ensure it is 5.5 OZ and then place it on your baking dish.

4. Mash your ripe banana in a small bowl until it becomes a smooth consistency. The banana should weigh about 2.5 OZ.

5. Scoop your banana mash into the hollowed section of the carrot. 

6. Bake the carrot-stuffed banana in the preheated oven for 60 minutes. 

7. While the carrot is baking, use a fruit scoop and scoop out the flesh of the apple. Using your kitchen scale, make sure it’s about 1 OZ.

8. Place the scooped apple in a small saucepot over medium heat and stir occasionally until it has reduced into a sweet, sticky sauce. This will take approximately 20-30 minutes.

9. Once the carrot is baked, pull out of the oven and let it cool for a moment. 

10. Slather the apple reduction sauce over the baked carrot-stuffed banana using a cooking brush, making sure that it’s completely covered.

11. Place it back into the oven for an additional 10 minutes, allowing the apple reduction to caramelize slightly.

12. After the final bake, remove your Deluxe Banana-Carrot Bake with Apple Reduction from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your sweet and savoury crafted dessert. 

Please note that this recipe, while seemingly simple due to its limited ingredients, requires precision in carving and scooping, careful monitoring of the cooking process to avoid burning, and an understanding of how to create a reduction. This is quite a melange of sweet and savoury with an earthy hint from the carrot. You will definitely love this creative and nutritious treat!
