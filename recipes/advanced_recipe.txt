Cook Time: 90+ minutes 

Difficulty: Advanced 

Servings: 1 

Kitchen Utensils: 
- slow cooker
- knife 
- cutting board 
- measuring spoons 
- measuring cups 
- stovetop pot

Ingredients:
- 16 OZ of pork ribs 
- 8 OZ of potatoes 
- 4 OZ of carrots 
- 4 OZ of bell pepper 
- 2 OZ of rice 
- 1 OZ of sour cream 

Instructions: 

1. Start by thoroughly washing all the vegetables - potatoes, carrots and bell pepper.

2. Cut the potatoes and carrots into bite-size chunks. For the bell pepper, remove the seeds first, then cut it into thin slices. 

3. Place the pork ribs in the slow cooker. Then add the chopped potatoes, carrots, and bell pepper.

4. Fill the slow cooker with enough water to completely submerge all the ingredients, then cover with the lid. 

5. Set the slow cooker on low heat and let it cook for about 90 minutes. 

6. After 90 minutes, check the pork ribs with a fork to see if they're tender. If not, continue cooking for another 30-60 minutes, until they're soft and easily pull apart.

7. While the ribs are cooking, cook the rice according to its package instructions. This typically involves rinsing the rice, combining it with water in a pot, and bringing it to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and let it simmer until all the water is absorbed.

8. When the pork ribs are done, remove them from the slow cooker and let them rest for a few minutes. 

9. Use a fork to gently pull the meat from the bones. Be careful as it will be very hot. Once all the meat is separated, discard the bones.

10. Add the cooked rice to a bowl. Add the sour cream and mix it in until the rice is fully coated.

11. Serve the pork ribs over the creamy rice. Add some of the slow-cooked vegetables on the side. The meal is now ready to serve. Enjoy your delicious and tender slow-cooked pork ribs with vegetables and creamy rice!

Please note: This is an advanced recipe due to the long cook time and use of multiple kitchen utensils including a slow cooker. The serving size is for one person but it can be easily multiplied for more servings.
