Difficulty: Advanced 

Servings: 1 

Kitchen Utensils: 
- Sharp knife 
- Grater 
- Stove-top pan 
- Oven 
- Baking tray
- Blending machine 

Ingredients: 
- 6 OZ of apple 
- 4 OZ of banana 
- 2 OZ of carrot 

Instructions:

1. Start by preheating your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Begin preparations by washing the apple and carrot thoroughly. You do not want any residue of dirt or pesticides on them.
3. Peel both the apple and carrot, and chop them into small dices. Keep aside. 
4. Now take the banana, peel it and slice into round thin circles. Keep aside. 
5. Place your stove-top pan on medium heat and add the diced apples and carrots into it. Allow them to steam a little till they soften. Make sure they don't lose their crispiness. This should take around 20 minutes.
6. After 20 minutes, take the pan off the stove and let the steamed apples and carrots cool down.
7. Once cooled, process them in the blending machine. Blend the apple, banana and carrot together until you achieve a smooth puree. 
8. Pour the puree mixture onto a baking tray, spreading evenly. Make sure the layer of the puree is not too thick.
9. Place the baking tray into the preheated oven and bake for around 60 minutes.
10. Keep checking every 15 minutes to prevent the mixture from burning. If it starts turning brown, lower the temperature a bit.
11. Once the mixture is thoroughly dried and crispy, turn off the oven and take out the baking tray.
12. Let the baked mixture cool down before consuming.
