Cook Time: 90+ Minutes

Difficulty: Intermediate 

Servings: 1

Kitchen Utensils: 
- Measuring Cups
- Cutting Board
- Knife
- Oven
- Dehydrator
- Parchment Paper
- Baking Tray

Ingredients:
- 4 OZ of Apple
- 4 OZ of Banana
- 4 OZ of Carrot

Instructions: 

Step 1:
Preheat your oven to 200°F (93°C). If using a dehydrator, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for fruit dehydration.

Step 2:
Thoroughly wash and dry your apple and carrot. Afterward, peel your banana.

Step 3:
Slice your apples, bananas, and carrots into similar sized pieces. Try and keep your slices about 1/4 inch thick to ensure they dehydrate effectively. 

Step 4:
Arrange the slices on a baking tray lined with a piece of parchment paper. Leave a little space between each slice to ensure even drying.

Step 5:
Place the baking tray in your preheated oven or dehydrator.

Step 6:
Let the fruits dry for around 1.5 hours. Then, flip the slices over to ensure they dry evenly.

Step 7:
Leave the slices in for another 1.5 hours or until they're fully dehydrated. The exact time might vary depending on your oven or dehydrator, so make sure to check on them frequently.

Step 8:
Once the dried fruits have cooled off, you can enjoy them as a snack, or store them in an airtight container.

Note: Watch closely for the last half hour to prevent over-drying or burning. The dried fruits should be flexible, not crispy. Your dehydrated fruits can last for several weeks if stored properly.
