Cook Time: 120 minutes
Difficulty: Advanced

Kitchen Utensils:
- Chef's knife
- Cutting board
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Mixing bowls
- Baking dish
- Oven

Ingredients (in oz):
- 2 large tomatoes (16 oz)
- 2 medium potatoes (12 oz)
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (24 oz)
- 1 bell pepper (7 oz)
- 4 tbsp sour cream (4 oz)
- 2 tbsp butter (1 oz)
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). 

2. Slice the top off the tomatoes and scoop out the pulp and seeds. Place the hollowed tomatoes in a baking dish.

3. Peel and chop the potatoes into small chunks. Spread the potato chunks around the tomatoes in the baking dish.

4. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Create a slit into one side of each chicken breast to form a pocket.

5. In a mixing bowl, combine sour cream, salt, and pepper. Mix well. 

6. Stuff each chicken breast with the sour cream mixture, then carefully place them on top of the potatoes in the baking dish.

7. Cut the bell pepper into strips and place them around the chicken breasts in the dish.

8. Spread the butter over the top of each chicken breast.

9. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for 60 minutes.

10. After 60 minutes, remove the aluminum foil and continue baking for an additional 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender.

11. While the chicken is baking, make the bell pepper sauce. In a small saucepan, combine the remaining bell pepper strips with 1/4 cup of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

12. Transfer the cooked bell pepper strips to a blender and blend until smooth. If desired, strain the sauce for a smoother consistency.

13. Once the chicken is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Serve the stuffed chicken breasts with the roasted potatoes and drizzle the bell pepper sauce over the top.
