- Whisk
- Knife

Ingredients: 
- 3 OZ of apple
- 3 OZ of banana
- 5 OZ of carrot

Instructions: 

1. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. While your oven is heating, take your kitchen utensils and ingredients to prepare.

2. Start with the apple, banana, and carrots. Peel off the skin thoroughly, then cut them into small chunks. Separate them for later use. 

3. Place the carrot on a baking tray, toss lightly in a drizzle of vegetable oil, then put the tray in the hot oven. Let it bake for approximately 35 minutes until it is soft and caramelized.

4. While the carrot is in the oven, turn to the apple and banana chunks. In a saucepan, add these chunks and add a little water. Let it simmer in low heat for a few minutes until the apples and bananas are soft and mushy.

5. Once all the three components are ready, take each one of them to blend. Start with the carrot; blend the roasted carrot into a fine puree. Repeat the same with the cooked apple and banana. You should have three separate purees ready.

6. Now, the task is to fold them together to create a beautiful mousse. Start with the carrot puree, add the apple-banana puree into it gradually while stirring. Stir until they have combined perfectly. The color should be vibrant and texture lush.

7. Once your mousse is ready, allow it to cool down. After it has reached room temperature, place it in the fridge to set. Let it be there for at least 20 minutes. 

8. After 20 minutes, take it out, whisk it briskly to incorporate some air, and place it back into the fridge. Repeat this step twice in an interval of 20 minutes. These steps ensure your mousse is light and fluffy.

9. Voila! Your spiced apple and banana carrot mousse is ready to be relished. Garnish it with a mint leaf, maybe add a dollop of cream on top, or granola at the bottom for added texture and dig in. Enjoy your gourmet dessert!
