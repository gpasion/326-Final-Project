Ingredients: 
- 8 OZ of Pork Ribs
- 2 OZ of Potatoes
- 2 OZ of Carrots
- 1 OZ of Bell Pepper
- 3 OZ of Rice
- 2 OZ of Sour Cream

Instructions:
1. Begin by rinsing 3 oz of rice under cold water until the water runs clear. 
2. In a saucepan, add the rinsed rice and 1.5 cups of water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes or until the rice is cooked through and all the water has been absorbed.
3. While the rice is cooking, dice 2 oz of potatoes, 2 oz of carrots, and 1 oz of bell pepper into bite-sized pieces.
4. In a frying pan, add the 8 oz of pork ribs and cook over medium heat until they start to brown. Turn frequently to avoid burning.
5. Add the chopped vegetables to the pan with the ribs. Stir occasionally until the vegetables are softened and slightly browned, about 10 minutes.
6. Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and add to the pan with ribs and vegetables. Stir everything together.
7. Lower the heat and stir in 2 oz of sour cream until everything is fully combined. Cook for an additional 2 minutes.
8. Transfer your cooked meal to a dish, let cool for a minute, then enjoy your quick and savory pork rib meal.
