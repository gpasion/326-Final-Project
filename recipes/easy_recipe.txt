Title: ABC (Apple Banana Carrot) Smoothie

Cook Time: 10 minutes

Difficulty: Easy 

Servings: 1

Kitchen Utensils: 
- blender 
- knife 
- cutting board 

Ingredients: 
- 8 OZ of apple 
- 6 OZ of banana
- 4 OZ of carrot 

Instructions: 

1. Start by washing your fresh produce. Since the apple and carrot will be eaten raw, make sure they are thoroughly cleaned.
 
2. Using a sharp knife and cutting board, peel the apple and carrot. If the banana isn't ripe enough to peel by hand, you may need to use the knife to help remove the skin.

3. Cut the apple, banana, and carrot into smaller chunks. The exact size doesn't matter as long as they can easily fit into your blender. 

4. Place the cut up pieces of apple, banana and carrot into the blender.

5. Blend on high until the smoothie reaches your desired consistency. If the mixture is too thick, try adding a splash of water or ice.

6. Once you're happy with the consistency, pour your ABC Smoothie into a glass and enjoy. You can also place in the fridge to chill for later.

Make sure to clean your blender and other used utensils promptly after use to prevent any leftover smoothie from sticking.
