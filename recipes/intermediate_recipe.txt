Cook Time: 60 minutes

Difficulty: Intermediate

Kitchen Utensils:
- Baking sheet
- Large skillet or frying pan
- Mixing bowl
- Knife
- Cutting board
- Wooden spoon
- Measuring cups and spoons

Ingredients:
- 4 chicken breasts (16 oz)
- 2 tablespoons butter, divided (1 oz)
- 4 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and diced (12 oz)
- 1 bell pepper, sliced (6 oz)
- 1 cup sour cream (8 oz)
- 1 cup diced tomatoes (8 oz)
- Salt and pepper to taste

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 400�F (200�C).

2. In a mixing bowl, toss the diced potatoes with 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Season with salt and pepper. Spread them evenly on a baking sheet and bake for about 30 minutes until golden brown and crispy.

3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon of butter in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, then add them to the pan. Cook each side for 5-6 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.

4. In the same skillet, add the sliced bell pepper and cook for about 5 minutes until slightly tender.

5. Reduce the heat to low and add the diced tomatoes to the skillet. Stir well and let it simmer for another 5 minutes.

6. Stir in the sour cream until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking for an additional 2 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

7. Return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet and coat them with the creamy tomato sauce. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the chicken is heated through.

8. Serve the creamy tomato chicken over the roasted potatoes and garnish with chopped fresh herbs, if desired.
