Instructions
Start by preparing the chicken breast:
Place the chicken breast on the cutting board.
Use the knife to trim any excess fat or skin.
Cut the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces or strips. Set aside.

Prepare the vegetables:
Wash the tomato, potato, and bell pepper under cold running water.
On the cutting board, chop the tomato into small cubes.
Peel the potato, if desired, and cut it into small cubes or slices.
Slice the bell pepper into thin strips.

Measure the ingredients:
Use the measuring cup to measure 4 oz of diced tomato.
Use the measuring cup to measure 8 oz of chopped potato.
Measure 2 oz of sour cream.
Measure 1 oz of butter.

Heat the pan:
Place the pan on the stovetop and turn the heat to medium-high.
Add the butter to the pan and allow it to melt.

Cook the chicken:
Add the chicken pieces to the pan.
Cook the chicken, stirring occasionally, until it is fully cooked and no longer pink in the center. This should take about 5-7 minutes.

Add the vegetables:
Add the diced tomatoes, chopped potatoes, and sliced bell peppers to the pan with the cooked chicken.
Cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the potatoes are golden brown.

Serve:
Plate the chicken and vegetable saute on a serving dish.
Serve with a dollop of sour cream on top.
